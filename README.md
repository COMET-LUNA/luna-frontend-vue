# Frontend Source Code - LUNA: Designing a Recommender System
This is the frontend code for the LUNA doctor finder system, written in typescript and Vue3.

## Installation
In order to install the packages necessary for the app, please run the following command: 

`npm install`

This will install the necessary npm packages to run the app.

## Development server and deployment

### Development
To run the development server on a localhost instance, after installing the packages run 

`npm run dev`

Please note that some functionality will not work without a concurrent instance of the backend for the app running. You can install and run a development instance of the backend here: https://github.com/COMET-LUNA/LUNA-backend

### Build and Deploy
To deploy the server, you may build the app using the command `npm run build` and host the app as static files on any server of your choice that can deliver the static content, or alternatively, use a hosting service provider such as Netlify or Heroku for an auto-push deployment.
